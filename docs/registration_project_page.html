                <h3>How can university course registration be improved?</h4>
                <p>
                    Every term, college students are saddled with the daunting task of registering for the next semester. Outdated and unintuitive software tools make this task even more difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of a semester, two colleauges and I set out to diagnose the problems with our own university's course registration system and prototype a solution to present to the advising office and the office of the registrar.

                    In order to improve the old system, we have to know what about it works and what doesn't. The best way to do this is to interview its current users - students at UNI.

            <h6> 
                After conducting and evaluating interviews with UNI students, we identified four primary pain points with the current course registration system. But don't take our word for it - hear it in the words of the users.
